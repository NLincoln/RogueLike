# RogueLike

This is a simple game that I'm working on for the purposes of learning. It uses SFML for rendering. All other code was written by me. It makes extensive use of C++14 features, such as range-based loops, lambda function objects, and std::function objects

So far, it includes things such as: 
* A Finite-State-Machine based AI (newer, and also extremely buggy)
* A callback-based event handler
* Procedural level generation
* Enemies change color relative to their damage

Things I'm in the process of making
* A simple HUD system for the players health / inventory
* A JSON based item description system so that items won't be described in code and can (theoretically?) be modified at runtime

Planned things:
* A particle effects system
* Different types of terrain
